# expressjs-getting-started

## Learned so far
- RESTful services using node and express
    - GET
    - POST
    - PUT
    - DELETE
- nodemon
- run on port taken from environment variable
- joi for validating requests
- object destructuring


### Notes
- Fast, lightweight and perfectly documented framework.

`npm init --yes` to get package.json
`npm i express` to get express installed
`npm i -g nodemon` need not restart the server always. run with nodemon
`npm i joi` to get joi
